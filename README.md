###Notice
You will have a folder in ~/shift-snapshot/ called `snapshot/` where all your snapshots will be created and stored.
If you want to use a snapshot from different place (official snapshot for example or other node) you will need to download the snapshot file (with prefix: shift_db*) and copy it to the `~/shift-snapshot/snapshot/` folder.
After you copy the shift_db*.tar file you can restore the blockchain with: `bash shift-snapshot.sh restore` and will use the last file found in the snapshot/ folder.<br>
If you use the `schedule` command be aware you will have a log file located in `~/shift-snapshot/cron.log` with this you will know what is happened with your schedule.

###Upgrade
If you are in a version prior to v0.2 you can upgrade with the following commands:
```
cd ~/shift-snapshot/ 
git checkout .
git pull
```
